PizzaOrder  -Adam Ingram

Background:
PizzaOrder.java is one of several demos I created in order to fully 
demonstrate the functionality of an Argument Parser created for
my Software Engineering I semester project.


Function:
This code serves to emulate a possible end use for an argument parser developed
by my SCRUM team and I. This code imagines the parsers use as a possible system for
taking orders at a pizza resturant. Using this in conjunction with my teams code we 
were able to consistently able to keep our customer (in this case our professor)
up to date with our progress. 

Code Breakdown:
- Initializes a new ArgumentParser
- Sets the programs description
- Sets the expected arguments
- Parses the users input.
- Displays the order back to the user.
